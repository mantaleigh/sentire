# sentire
TUI Fall 2016

Sentire means "to feel" in Latin and is the name of a product currently in the stages of design for our Tangible User Interfaces class at Wellesley College. As a team of three students, we are creating a wearable mood and related environmental factor tracking bracelet using Arduino.

The intended user groups are busy people wanting to keep track of their mood, day to day events, and environmental factors; museum or conference goers who want to collect reaction and participation data; and caretakers of children on the autism spectrum who need to collect data to determine factors related to mood and function.
